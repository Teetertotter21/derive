## Site 1
https://www.aeropostale.com/fb-lp/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMItKbMusaE4AIVXbXACh0Y5gMTEAAYASAAEgLd1_D_BwE (Aeropostale)
I found this site through a link on twitter. The design actually seems quite nice to look at, flows nice. I'd say the non-moving background makes it feel smooth to scroll up and down. For the most part it is rather easy to find things, it took me a while to find the t-shirt section but aside from that it was rather easy. The clearance acrea is interactive and the female shopping section is interactive. My one word to describe this website would be nice. its nothing overly special but it is really nice to look at and just scroll through. If i could change anything about the site it would have to be to change the spacing between some of the titles, sections, etc. For example one part the "SHOP GIRLS" and "SHOP GUYS" and "Follow Us" button are basically touching eachother, yet they are different categories. 8/10.

I found this site whilst scrolling through my Instagram feed. The site is okay for the most part, the colors are nice, but I don't like how much stuff is on the home page. There's too many interactive features on the first page for my liking. The navigation system is rather good. it shows all the stuff for the current season (its winter so they are showing coats, snow boarding gear, etc). Basically every single thing on this website is interactive lol. in all honesty I'm not a huge can of this website, easy 6/10. If i could change anything i think i would put more things in interactive folders, like make a folder of all winter stuff, then all you have to do is click that and then go to all the winter stuff, and do that with all the topics.

Well as you know i work there, so i decided to do a nice little critique on my own work. It looks alright, nothing to special to be honest, nice use of colors and empty space. The navigation actually isnt too bad, like stated in the last website, i like when things are organized and this one is actually pretty organized. Basically everything that you hover over will be interactive, there's the odd thing that isn't interactive but for the most part everything is interactive. Overal the site isn't too bad, but i hate working there so therefore i hate the website, 4/10. I would change the fact that i work there and then i could give it an actual rating.

## Site 4
https://random-ize.com/random-website/
I got here from Carter (another student) and its quite interesting to be honest, what it does is generate a random website that someone has made. It isnt that nice to look at, it's very plain, kinda boring, but the main point of this website isnt to look nice its to find other websites. The main navigation is the button that says "Next Website" and it opens a new tab with a new website. The interactive part is the "Next Website" button. I like the idea of the website but i don't like the look of the website. I would change the color idea of it.

## Site 5
https://www.purristan.com/
I got this website from a random website generator ^. Not regarding what the website is about, it actually looks really nice, probably one of the best websites i've ever seen. It looks really nice, design wise. The Navigation system is nice, all you do is scroll and you'll find everything. They're labelled at the top and everything. Notn much is interactive to be honest. I really enjoy the site, so much that i signed up to be apart of their cult :). I personally wouldn't change anything on this website. 9/10.
